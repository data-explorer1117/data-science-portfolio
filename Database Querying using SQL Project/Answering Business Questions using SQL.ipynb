    "## ANSWERING BUSINESS QUESTIONS USING SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we're going to use SQL skills to answer questions pertaining to a fictional digital music business.  The database that we'll access is called \"chinook.db\".  Here is a description of a few of the tables in this database:  (1) employee - this table lists pertinent personnel information such as the employee ID, their full names, addresses, hire dates, etc.; (2) customer - this summarizes info pertaining to customer ID, full names, addresses, and the sales representative that is assigned to each customer; (3) invoice - tracks all the invoices processed which include the customer who made the purchase, location where the purchase was made, and the invoice total; (4) invoice line - tracks all the details for each of the invoices as it lists all the individual music tracks purchased per each invoice, the price of the track, and quantity bought; (5) track - provides specific info about each track such as track ID, name, album ID, genre type, etc.; (6) album - gives detailed info on the album ID, name, and the artist who produced the album.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using SQL queries to determine things such as the number of tracks sold per each genre in the USA, the total dollar amount of sales made by each sales support agent in the company, and which invoice happens to be a full album purchase vs. individual track purchase."
