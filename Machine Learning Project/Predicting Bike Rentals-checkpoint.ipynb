    "In this project, we'll evaluate different machine learning algorithms in terms of their abilities to predict the number of bike rentals at a given facility in Washington, D.C.  Each of these models will be trained using historical data from the facility as provided by the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Group at [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset)  \n",
    "\n",
    "The models that we'll be exploring are Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.  Relevant data inputs that will be used to predict the number of rentals include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) the season during which the rental occurred; (2) the time of the day of the rental; (3) whether the day was a holiday; (4) the temperature on the day of the rental, etc. \n",
